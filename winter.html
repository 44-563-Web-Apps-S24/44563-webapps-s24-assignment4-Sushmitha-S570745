<h6 class="name TUZENBACH">TUZENBACH.</h6> <p class="speech">Oh, no. Forty or forty-five, at the very outside.</p> <p class="direction">[Plays
softly]</p><p class="speech">He seems rather a good sort. He's certainly no fool, only he
likes to hear himself speak.</p>

<h6 class="name IRINA">IRINA.</h6><p class="speech">Is he interesting?</p>

<h6 class="name TUZENBACH">TUZENBACH.</h6> <p class="speech">Oh, he's all right, but there's his wife, his mother-in-law,
and two daughters. This is his second wife. He pays calls and tells
everybody that he's got a wife and two daughters. He'll tell you so
here. The wife isn't all there, she does her hair like a flapper and
gushes extremely. She talks philosophy and tries to commit suicide every
now and again, apparently in order to annoy her husband. I should have
left her long ago, but he bears up patiently, and just grumbles.</p>

<h6 class="name SOLENI">SOLENI.</h6> <p class="direction">[Enters with CHEBUTIKIN from the dining-room]</p> <p class="speech">With one hand I
can only lift fifty-four pounds, but with both hands I can lift 180,
or even 200 pounds. From this I conclude that two men are not twice as
strong as one, but three times, perhaps even more....</p>

out... take an ounce of naphthaline and hail a bottle of spirit...
dissolve and use daily....</p><p class="direction">[Makes a note in his pocket diary]</p> <p class="speech">When
found make a note of! Not that I want it though....</p> <p class="direction">[Crosses it out]</p> <p class="speech">It
doesn't matter.</p>
