ACT I

<p class="direction">[In PROSOROV'S house. A sitting-room with pillars; behind is seen a
large dining-room. It is midday, the sun is shining brightly outside. In
the dining-room the table is being laid for lunch.]</p>

<p class="direction">[OLGA, in the regulation blue dress of a teacher at a girl's high
school, is walking about correcting exercise books; MASHA, in a black
dress, with a hat on her knees, sits and reads a book; IRINA, in white,
stands about, with a thoughtful expression.]</p>

<h6 class="OLGA name">OLGA.</h6> 
<p class="speech">It's just a year since father died last May the fifth, on your
name-day, Irina. It was very cold then, and snowing. I thought I would
never survive it, and you were in a dead faint. And now a year has
gone by and we are already thinking about it without pain, and you are
wearing a white dress and your face is happy.<p class="direction">[Clock strikes twelve]</p> And
the clock struck just the same way then. <p class="direction">[Pause]</p> I remember that there
was music at the funeral, and they fired a volley in the cemetery. He
was a general in command of a brigade but there were few people present.
Of course, it was raining then, raining hard, and snowing.</p>

<h6 class="IRINA">IRINA.</h6><p class="speech"> Why think about it!</p>

<p class="direction">[BARON TUZENBACH, CHEBUTIKIN and SOLENI appear by the table in the
dining-room, behind the pillars.]</p>

<h6 class="OLGA">OLGA.</h6><p class="speech">It's so warm to-day that we can keep the windows open, though the
birches are not yet in flower. Father was put in command of a brigade,
and he rode out of Moscow with us eleven years ago. I remember perfectly
that it was early in May and that everything in Moscow was flowering
then. It was warm too, everything was bathed in sunshine. Eleven years
have gone, and I remember everything as if we rode out only yesterday.
Oh, God! When I awoke this morning and saw all the light and the spring,
joy entered my heart, and I longed passionately to go home.</p>

<h6 class="CHEBUTIKIN">CHEBUTIKIN.</h6> <p class="speech">Will you take a bet on it?</p>

<h6 class="TUZENBACH">TUZENBACH.</h6> <p class="speech">Oh, nonsense.</p>

<p class="direction">[MASHA, lost in a reverie over her book, whistles softly.]</p>


<h6 class="OLGA">OLGA.</h6> <p class="speech">Don't whistle, Masha. How can you! <p class="direction">[Pause]</p> I'm always having
headaches from having to go to the High School every day and then teach
till evening. Strange thoughts come to me, as if I were already an old
woman. And really, during these four years that I have been working
here, I have been feeling as if every day my strength and youth have
been squeezed out of me, drop by drop. And only one desire grows and
gains in strength...</p>

<h6 class="IRINA">IRINA.</h6> <p class="speech">To go away to Moscow. To sell the house, drop everything here,
and go to Moscow...</p>

<h6 class="OLGA">OLGA.</h6><p class="speech"> Yes! To Moscow, and as soon as possible.</p>

<p class="direction">[CHEBUTIKIN and TUZENBACH laugh.]</p>

<h6 class="IRINA">IRINA.</h6> <p class="speech">I expect Andrey will become a professor, but still, he won't want
to live here. Only poor Masha must go on living here.</p>

<h6 class="OLGA">OLGA.</h6><p class="speech">Masha can come to Moscow every year, for the whole summer.</p>

<p class="direction">[MASHA is whistling gently.]</p>

<h6 class="IRINA">IRINA.</h6> <p class="speech">Everything will be arranged, please God. <p class="direction">[Looks out of the
window]</p> It's nice out to-day. I don't know why I'm so happy: I
remembered this morning that it was my name-day, and I suddenly felt
glad and remembered my childhood, when mother was still with us. What
beautiful thoughts I had, what thoughts!</p>

<h6 class="OLGA">OLGA.</h6> <p class="speech">You're all radiance to-day, I've never seen you look so lovely.
And Masha is pretty, too. Andrey wouldn't be bad-looking, if he wasn't
so stout; it does spoil his appearance. But I've grown old and very
thin, I suppose it's because I get angry with the girls at school.
To-day I'm free. I'm at home. I haven't got a headache, and I feel
younger than I was yesterday. I'm only twenty-eight.... All's well, God
is everywhere, but it seems to me that if only I were married and could
stay at home all day, it would be even better. <p class="direction">[Pause]</p> I should love my
husband.</p>

<h6 class="TUZENBACH">TUZENBACH.</h6> <p class="direction">[To SOLENI]</p><p class="speech">I'm tired of listening to the rot you talk.</p>
<p class="direction">[Entering the sitting-room]</p><p>I forgot to say that Vershinin, our new
lieutenant-colonel of artillery, is coming to see us to-day.</p><p class="direction"> [Sits down
to the piano.]</p>

<h6 class="OLGA">OLGA.</h6><p class="speech">That's good. I'm glad.</p>
